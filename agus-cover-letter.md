# Cover Letter for Upwork by Agus Nurwanto

thanks for inviting me

kalimat pertama saat diinvet oleh calon client

==========================================



Fulltime freelance WordPress Developer. WordPress is my life.

I've been helping many companies and people build their blogs, personal websites, company profiles, and many other type of websites with WordPress.

Most of my clients are satisfied with my work. They show appreciation for my work by making repeated orders and referring clients to me.

For me, the greatest happiness I've ever felt is when my clients have told me that, the website I created for them, brings their business more success or that they find it useful.

I am sure I can help you too :)

Hire me, and your satisfaction is guaranteed :)
